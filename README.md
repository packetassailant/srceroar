# srceroar

## Objective
```
Srceroar, pronounced Sorcerer, is a NodeJS application that is a somewhat different way of creating 
wordlists. Specifically, srceroar uses archives obtained from various locations, such as sourceforge 
and git repositories, in order to build custom wordlists. The wordlists are comprised of only those 
unique words found in the archive source bundle (e.g., directory paths and file names). 

This allows a security pen tester to leverage this utility as a means to attack an application that 
they may have very limited prior knownledge. For instance, a penetration test might identify an 
open-source content management system (CMS) but might be a relatively new project, or the penetration 
tester has noted that the CMS has been installed in non standard build locations. The pen tester can 
then use the srceroar tool to download the CMS source code and generate a custom wordlist necessary 
to explore the runtime application. 

As of now, this utility only accomodates downloading and wordlist generation. It is up to the 
penetration tester to use this wordlist in conjunction with an automated exploration tool. The 
following tools are commonly used for wordlist based attacks in similar situations:

1. Burp Suite Intruder
2. Dirbuster
3. Dirb
```


## Usage
```
$ node srceroar.js -h 
Create wordlists from source code archives (e.g., src-tarball.tar.gz).    	
Usage: node ./srceroar.js (-i archive || -u download-url) -o wordlist-output-file

Options: 
  -h, --help     Show Usage and opts (i.e., this list of opt/args)                                      
  -i, --infile   Input archive file                                                                     
  -o, --outfile  Output wordlist file                                                                   
  -u, --url      Input archive download URL (e.g., http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.12/node-v0.10.12.tar.gz) 
  -g, --gitrepo  Input git repo to clone 

Note: Srceroar will clean up after itself by recursively deleting the temporary download directory 
(e.g., /tmp/cdhimt2c6) 
```

## Installation 
```
Srceroar was developed and tested on OSX ML 
 ----------- OSX --------------- 
git clone https://github.com/packetassailant/srceroar.git 
cd srceroar 
sudo npm install //this will install npm dependent modules in the local ./node_modules directory 

Note: The nodegit module requires cmake in order to build the native C implementation of git (this is not 
a wrapper for git). It is advised that you leverage the operating system's package management system to 
install cmake to a location that is available within the path. For instance, macports has a cmake binary 
and will automagically install within /opt/local/bin.
```

## Sample Run
```
$ node srceroar.js -g https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit.git -o /tmp/test.out 
info: Downloading the nodegit GIT repo to: /tmp/cdhimt2c6 
info: Finished downloading nodegit to: /tmp/cdhimt2c6 
info: Processing directory contents of: /tmp/cdhimt2c6 
info: Creating wordlist file: /tmp/test.out 
info: Finished creating wordlist file: /tmp/test.out
